<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p  style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
Swarm robotics has become an increasingly significant domain in the field of robotics, drawing inspiration from the collective behaviors observed in natural systems such as
flocks of birds, schools of fish, and colonies of insects. This burgeoning area seeks to understand, model, and replicate
these intricate behaviors within artificial systems comprising multiple autonomous robots. Craig Reynolds’ seminal work in 1987 introduced a set of behavioral rules, serving as fundamental principles for simulating emergent behaviors in decentralized systems. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> The objective of this project is to delve into the practical implementation and assessment of Reynolds’ behavioral
rules within a simulated environment in a (ROS) framework and the Stage simulator. Building upon the three
core rules of Reynolds’; separation, alignment, and cohesion, the project aims to extend the swarm’s capabilities by
introducing Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance behaviors.
Navigation enables the swarm to move towards predefined
points within the environment, gradually decelerating as
they approach the target and coming to a stop at the designated location. Simultaneously, the Obstacle Avoidance
rule equips the swarm with the capability to detect and
evade obstacles present in the environment, adjusting their
trajectories to circumvent potential collisions.
The simulated robots, represented as omnidirectional
entities, undergo rigorous testing across various simulated
scenarios and environments. The evaluation focuses on analyzing the swarm’s collective behavior, adaptability, and
robustness in response to diverse environmental conditions.
This project seeks to bridge theoretical concepts with
practical implementation, offering insights into the dynamics of collective behaviors exhibited by robotic swarms governed by Reynolds’ rules and additional algorithms within
simulated settings </p>

  <!-- <li><h2>Local Neighbourhood</h2></li>
  <p>The local neighbourhood is defined as the area around a boid in which it senses and responds to its peers. This detection enables boids to engage in complex behaviors such as alignment, cohesion, and separation, which are fundamental to achieving realistic flocking movement. It’s a dynamic concept, adjusting as boids move and their relative distances change.</p>

      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>The local neighbourhood encompasses the immediate surroundings of a boid, allowing it to detect other boids and obstacles within a certain range. </p>

  <li><h2>Local Neighbourhood</h2></li>
  <!-- <p>The local neighbourhood is defined as the area around a boid in which it senses and responds to its peers. This concept is crucial for implementing swarm behaviors, as it determines how individual boids perceive and interact with each other, influencing the collective movement and decision-making processes of the swarm.</p> -->

  <!-- <p>The local neighbourhood delineates the area around a boid where it can sense and interact with others. This concept underpins the adaptive and cohesive movements seen in swarms, allowing for a decentralized decision-making process that results in complex, emergent behaviors. It dynamically adjusts as the swarm moves, ensuring that each boid's actions are influenced by its immediate surroundings.</p> -->

  <p class="explanation">The local neighbourhood around a boid encompasses the area where it can sense and interact with other boids, critically influenced by spatial proximity and directional alignment. Spatial proximity refers to how close other boids are, while directional alignment and field of view (FoV) consider the direction boids are facing relative to each other. Together, these factors ensure a boid only responds to others within a certain distance and within its line of sight, enabling more natural and cohesive swarm behaviors. This blend of proximity and FoV helps simulate complex interactions and movements, mirroring the nuanced dynamics seen in natural swarms.</p>

  <h1>Achieving Coordination</h1>

<h2 >Local Migratory Urge</h2>
 <p id="explanation"> The Arrival behavior is designed for the robots to reach a designated position while gradually slowing down as the swarm
  gets closer to the target. This behavior carefully adjusts the swarm’s
  speed, gradually reducing it until it comes to a complete
  stop at the target location. The process starts when the flock
  is still a considerable distance from the target, moving at its
  maximum speed. As it enters a predefined slowing distance, the speed begins to diminish. Beyond this radius, the
  desired velocity stays at the maximum limit, but once inside,
  it’s steadily reduced to zero. To smoothen this convergence,
  the hyperbolic tangent function (tanh) is used. This step-by-step reduction in speed, triggered when the current speed
  surpasses a set slowdown level and the swarm is within the
  slowing radius, ensures that the flock decelerates smoothly,
  ultimately stopping precisely at the goal. The steering force
  also decreases accordingly, reducing to zero as the target is
  neared.</p>

  <h2>System Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    Our system's architecture is based on the Robot Operating System (ROS), which facilitates the integration and processing of various data streams critical to autonomous navigation. Config Parameters initialize the system by defining operational constraints such as field of view (FOV) range and angle, behavior weights, priority lists, in-case of arrival (method for leader determination, and number of leaders), which are essential for delineating the interactive space between robots.
  </p>
  <div align="center">

    <br />Figure 1: Swarm Algorithm Pipeline<br />
  </div>
    
  <p>
    The determination of <strong>Neighbours</strong> relies on the position and velocity information provided by ROS, filtered through the specified Config Parameters. This process ensures that only relevant nearby entities are considered for subsequent behavioral calculations.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Goals</strong> input conveys target locations to the boids, directing navigational behaviors. The 'Seek' behavior propels the flock toward these targets, while the 'Arrival' behavior manages deceleration and precise stopping at the destination points.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>Gridmap</strong> input supplies the layout of the environment, identifying navigable versus occupied spaces. This information is crucial for the 'Obstacle Avoidance' behavior, enabling the flock to navigate around impediments effectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>Accumulator</strong> balances the output from the 'Basic Behaviours' module, which comprises 'Seek', 'Arrival', and 'Obstacle Avoidance'. Whether to strongploy a priority list is a configurable parameter that influences how the accumulator behaves. It prioritizes (if specified) and sums these behaviors to generate appropriate 'acceleration', scaling thstrong based on the specified weight for each behavior. This prioritization is essential in scenarios where immediate environmental responses must be balanced with long-term navigational goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>Motion Model</strong> calculates the new velocity <strong>v = u + at</strong> by adding the acceleration from the <strong>Accumulator</strong> with the boids prior velocity. It then issues <strong>Velocity Commands</strong> that actuate the boids movstrongent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, the <strong>Stage Simulator</strong> component simulates a physical environment for the robots, providing a feedback loop that refines the 'Motion Model' through 'Velocity Commands' derived from behavioral outputs. This simulation ensures that modeled behaviors are reflective of potential real-world scenarios.

  <p>
  To conclude, this project aimed to implement Reynolds’
  rules for swarm control in a simulated environment using robots. Initially, the basic Reynolds’ rules—separation,
  alignment, and cohesion—were successfully implemented
  and tested in the Stage simulator within a mapped frame.
  In this phase, we expanded the Reynolds’ rules to include
  navigation to specific points and obstacle avoidance for
  the swarm. These additions aimed to enhance the swarm’s
  capabilities by enabling it to navigate towards designated
  points while gradually reducing speed as it neared the
  goal, and to actively evade obstacles as they came into
  proximity. The thorough testing across diverse maps, encompassing various obstacles and maze structures, allowed
  us to evaluate how well these rules performed and adapted
  within different scenarios. Moving forward, the transition to
  hardware implementation stands as the future work for this
  project. Real-world application of these refined rules and
  innovative algorithms on physical robots would validate
  their practicality and efficiency, opening doors for their
  integration into various industries where swarm intelligence
  could bring about substantial advancements

<p id="explanation">The results obtained match the ground truth trajectory initially, but small errors accumulate resulting in egregious poses if algorithm is run for longer travel time. It is to be noted that although the absolute position is wrong for latter frames the relative motion (translation and rotation) is still tracked. SLAM characteristics like loop closure can be used to help correct the drift in measurement.</p>

<p>There are several tunable parameters in the algorithm which can be tuned to adjust the accuracy of output, some of the parameters are: block size for disparity computation and KLT tracker, various error thresholds such as for KLT tracker, feature re-projection, clique rigidity constraint. More work is required to develop an adaptive framework which adjusts their parameters based on feedback and other sensor data.</p>

<p>All brightness-based motion tracker perform poorly for sudden changes in image luminance, therefore a robust brightness invariant motion tracking algorithm is needed to accurately predict motion. Neural networks such as Universal Correspondence Networks [3] can be tried out but the real-time runtime constrains of visual odometry may not accommodate for it. A faster inlier detection algorithm is also needed to speed up the algorithm, added heuristics such as an estimate how accurate each feature 2D-3D point pair is can help with early termination of inlier detection algorithm.</p> -->
